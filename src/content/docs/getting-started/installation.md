---

## Prerequisites

Ard requires Go 1.19 or later to build and run. Ensure Go is installed on the system:

```bash
go version
```

## Installing from Source

Currently, Ard is available only from source. Clone the repository and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akonwi/ard.git
cd ard
go build -o ard main.go
```

This creates an `ard` executable in the project directory.

## Adding to PATH

To use Ard from anywhere, add the executable to the system PATH:

### macOS/Linux
```bash
# Move to a directory in PATH
sudo mv ard /usr/local/bin/

# Or add the project directory to PATH
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/ard"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Windows
Add the directory containing `ard.exe` to the system PATH through Environment Variables.

## Verify Installation

Test the installation:

```bash
ard --version
```

## Next Steps

With Ard installed, proceed to [create your first program](/getting-started/first-program/).
