## What is Ard?

Ard is a modern, programming language designed for legibility, simplicity, and type-safety.
It combines elements from JavaScript, Swift, Go, and Rust.

		Ard code should be easy to read and understand with clear, expressive syntax designed for readability.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Simple" icon="approve-check">
		There should be one obvious way to do things. Ard follows Go's philosophy for left-to-right readability.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Safe" icon="warning">
		The compiler catches type errors and there are no unexpected runtime failures.

## Quick Example

```ard
use ard/io

fn main() {
  mut numbers: [Int] = []
  io::print("numbers.size = {numbers.size()}")

  io::print("adding numbers from 0 to 10")
  for i in 0..10 {
    numbers.push(i)
  }

  io::print("numbers.size = {numbers.size()}")
  for n in numbers {
    io::print(n)
  }

  io::print("7th element = {numbers.at(6)}")
}
```
