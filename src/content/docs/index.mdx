## What is Ard?

Ard is a modern, statically-typed programming language that combines the best features from JavaScript, Swift, and Go while introducing its own unique characteristics. It is designed with three core principles in mind:

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Readable" icon="open-book">
		Ard code should be easy to read and understand with clear, expressive syntax designed for readability.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Simple" icon="rocket">
		There should be one obvious way to do things. Ard follows Go's philosophy for left-to-right readability.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Safe" icon="approve-check">
		The compiler catches errors at compile time, and there are no exceptions - errors are values.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Reliable" icon="setting">
		Runtime is built in Go, making it fast and efficient with future plans to compile to Go for portability.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Key Features

- **Static typing** with type inference
- **Pattern matching** with powerful match expressions
- **Error handling** with Result types (no exceptions)
- **Async programming** with fibers (green threads)
- **Traits system** for shared behavior
- **Module system** with absolute imports
- **Memory safety** without garbage collection overhead

## Quick Example

```ard
use ard/io

fn fibonacci(n: Int) Int {
  match n {
    0 => 0
    1 => 1
    _ => fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
  }
}

fn main() {
  for i in 1..10 {
    io::print("fib({i.to_str()}) = {fibonacci(i).to_str()}")
  }
}
```
